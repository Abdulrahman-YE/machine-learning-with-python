# machine-learning-with-python
- This is my own solutions of the exercises part of Prof.Andrew NG course in Machine Learning. I followed the python version of the exercises writen by @dibgerge Thanks to his effort the exercises has been easier to solve instead of the MATLAB version.
### Exercises:
#### 1 - Linear regression 
- One variable linear regression : Predict the profit of a food truck based on populatios.
- Multivariable linear regression : Predict the house price based on size and number of bedrooms
#### 2 - Logistic Regression 
- Linear logistic regression : admitte a student to university based on two exams score 
- Regularized logistic regression :  predict whether microchips from a fabrication plant passes quality assurance (QA). During QA, each microchip goes through various tests to ensure it is functioning correctly.
